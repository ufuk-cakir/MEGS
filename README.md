## MEGS: Morphological Evaluation of Galactic Structure 

This project, developed by Ufuk Ã‡akir, introduces the MEGS software, designed to execute a PCA-based model for the morphological evaluation of galactic structures.
*Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), Heidelberg University, 06/2023*

The MEGS software includes preprocessing scripts for galaxy images, PCA computation routines, and modules for the low-dimensional projection of these galaxy images. For usage details, see [input](doc/input.md). The methods are exhaustively described in [method](doc/method.md). More detailed information on the input parameters can be found in [parameters](doc/parameters.md). A detailed source code description is given through the sphinx documentation hosted on [Read the docs](https://megs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The software requires a Python environment with scientific computing libraries such as `numpy` and `scikit-learn` installed.

For installation, run  
`source setup.sh`
